"""
Negative indexing :-
In Python, negative sequence indexes represent positions from the end of the array. 
Instead of having to compute the offset as in List[len(List)-3], it is enough to just write List[-3]. 
Negative indexing means beginning from the end, -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second-last item, etc.

List = [1, 2, 'Geeks', 4, 'For', 6, 'Geeks'] 

# accessing a element using 
# negative indexing 
print("Accessing element using negative indexing") 

# print the last element of list 
print(List[-1]) 

# print the third last element of list 
print(List[-3])

Output:
