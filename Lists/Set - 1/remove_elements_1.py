remove() :-
Elements can be removed from the List by using built-in remove() function but an Error arises if element doesn’t exist in the set. 
Remove() method only removes one element at a time, to remove range of elements, iterator is used. The remove() method removes the specified item.

Note – Remove method in List will only remove the first occurrence of the searched element.
